## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

We are gonna start by linking the .js into the HTML, we continue by building an additional section in the HTML, build the Navigation bar and add functionality to: sections and scrolling.
Finally, we will refactor the code to finish with a clean javaScript code.
